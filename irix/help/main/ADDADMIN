     Use:      Used to add a Channel Service Admin to cservice 
               database. Accessible to 700+ members only. Same rules
               apply (See ADDUSER)
               If the user you wish to add is online at the time, you
               can have \n figure out their mask by using ADDADMIN
               without putting a nick!user@host; they then are added
               with the default settings and their current nick will
               be their IDnick
     Example:  /msg \n ADDADMIN Bill *!*bclinton@*.whitehouse.gov
