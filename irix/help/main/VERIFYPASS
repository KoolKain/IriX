     Syntax:   VERIFYPASS <channel> <IDnick> <password>
     Uses:     Used to verify a user is who they say they are, if
               a user is unable to auth due to a host mask change.
     Note:     The user must supply the password to you, so that it
               may be un-encrypted, the bot will only tell you whether
               it was valid or not.
