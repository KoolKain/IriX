                           INSTALL file        by Othernet <cs5@othernet.org>


This is the CS5.0 Channel Services
This code has run successfully on BSD, SunOS, Linux, and Dec Unix

The installation of CS5.0 exists of the following steps:

1) cd base directory
2) `make'
3) edit config/cserve.conf
4) create initial cservice admin account
5) Explaination of other files in config directory
6) Running CS5

1) cd into the base directory
=============================

Make this directory your current directory by typing:

cd CS5.0

2) `make'
=========

For SunOS or BSD and RedHat 5 you will need to type `make sunos' 
or `make bsd' or `make rh5' all others just type `make generic'
including  pre redhat 5

3) Edit config/cserve.conf
=========================

CS5.0 allows for extensive configuration which also allows
for changes without recompiling.  The file is located in the
config directory.  Each entry has an accompanying explaination
It is critical to the operation of CS5 that these enteries are
filled out properly.

4) create initial cservice admin account 
========================================

To operate the bot you will need to add the initial admin entry.
The Channel Services channel is the channel that defines what user
are considered CSAdmin, this is defined in the cserve.conf file using
the CSADMINCHAN variable.  The default setting for this channel is
#cservice.  Depending on what you define the CSAdmin channel as will
dictate what you do next

  If you leave the name #cservice
   a)  Using the mkpasswd utility in the config directory
       create a encrypted passwd.
   b)  modify the file in the database/chanusr directory
       called %043cservice and replace the current encrypted
       password with your new one.
   c)  change the current IDNick to yours
   d)  and add a matching nick!user@hostmask to match yours
       example:
           opus 1000 0 0 0 4iRoZgPHyYDsg 903143770 *!*opus@*.othernet.org
   format of this file is as follows:
           IDNick Level Autoops Protect Suspend Password Lastseen nick!user@hostmask

  If you choose to create a different named CSAdmin channel
   a)  edit database/regs.dat and change the channel name to match as defined
       by the CSADMINCHAN in config/cserve.conf
           #newchannel nick!user@hostmask
       this is the channel name and the owners mask
   b)  mv database/chanusr/%043cservice /database/chanusr/%043newname
   c)  mv database/chanopt/%043cservice /database/chanopt/%043newname
   d)  Using the mkpasswd utility in the config directory
       create a encrypted passwd.
   e)  modify the file in the databas/chanusr directory
       called %043newname and replace the current encrypted
       password with your new one.
   f)  change the current IDNick to yours
   g)  and change the current mask to match yours
       example:
           opus 1000 0 0 0 4iuK/itKyriMg 903143770 *!*opus@*.othernet.org
       format of this line is as follows:
           IDNick Level Autoops Protect Suspend Password Lastseen nick!user@hostmask

5)  Explaination of other files in config directory
===================================================

	Makefile		Generic makefile for mkpasswd.c

	Makefile.bsd		BSD makefile for mkpasswd.c

	command.dat		File containing list of commands for
				keeping track of command name changes
				*** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ***

	command.dat.dist	Clean copy and backup of original distributed
				command.dat
				*** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ***

	cserve.conf		File that contains all the start up configuration 
				parameters

	cserve.conf.dist        Clean copy and backup of original distributed

				*** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ***

   	mkpasswd.c		Source code for creating encrypted passwords


6)  Running CS5
===============

To run CS5 be sure to be in the base directory that the CS5 exists in
In this case it would be the CS5/ directory.  If for any reason you start it 
from another directory you will experience some very uncomfortable side 
affects.  There is no need to run it in back ground or to nohup it, it will
fork and do it on it's own.  So to start CS5

cd CS5
./O

and you are off and running.
