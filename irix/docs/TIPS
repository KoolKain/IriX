Tips and Suggestions
====================
1)  It is suggested to create a cron to check if CS5 is running or not.  After
    starting CS5 a file containing the pid of CS5 will be created(called O.pid)
    you can use this to look for the process in a a script.  A sample script can
    be found in the CS5.0/bin directory along with a cron example.

2)  It is also suggested to perform regular backups of the database directory,
    this can be done via a cron also.  A sample script is in cluded in the 
    CS5.0/bin directory and included in the cron example.

3)  Being there is no conversion scripts for CS4 to CS5 you will need to either
    start over or convert to the new format.  You can get all the info you need
    from the existing entry for the #cservice channel in the CS5/database directory.

4)  Remember to check the log size often to not alow your hard drive to fill up
    CS5.0/logs directory

5)  If you have many users it is recommended to disable the command character
    You do this by setting the bot mode to +d in the cserve.conf file.
    MYMODES +owsk ---> MYMODES +odwsk
    then kill the bot and restart it.

6)  If the bot dies and you have the logging enabled, the last line in the log will 
    help indicate the reason it is dying, not fool proof, but a good indicator.  If
    you are reporting a bug, please include the last 10 lines of the log.  This will 
    to be grabbed prior to the bot restarting.

7)  The passwords in the channel user files are encrypted and you cnnot get them for
    a user if requested.  If a user can supply you the password, to prove they are
    who they say they are, you can use the VERIFYPASS command to see if it matches,
    thus modifying a changed host mask for the user with the knowledge of them being
    the rightful person.
