  Min is the author of the original Xbot that is 
  freely distributed, it is this bot that i used to 
  get an idea of how to code a bot for services.
  Many thanks to Min S. Kwon

  Back when we first started Othernet, it was Rob
  and I that painstakenly worked on our then X 
  which at that time was P09.  If it wasn't for
  Robs effort, i might still be hacking at the 
  IRC syntax's

  Thanks John

devon!devon@othernet.org (Michael Dabrowski)
  And then there was devon, what a nag, hehe
  Devon was the person driving the design and
  driving me to do it right.  Devon thanks for
  countless hours and the opportunity to work
  with you and your designs.

All the loyal users in the Othernet family that 
put up with the daily nonsence of my woking on 
CS5 and using them as lab rats.  I apologize 
for not being able to list you all here, for 
fear of leaving some one out.

Many thanks to all of you, it isn't the best bot
nor the prettiest, but there is alot of heart in
it, do don't trash me to hard.
