If this is a new install, ignore this file
If you you are upgrading from CS5.0 to CS5.1 you will need
to take a few steps to accomplish the upgrade.  

There is a new command added, `addthishost', and if you do not 
follow these instruction the bot will not load all the commands
and will not function properly.

When you untar CS5.1 it will put it into a new directory called 
CS5.1.  After it has completed you then follow the instructions
to make the new services.  After that has completed copy the entire
CS5.0/database directory to the CS5.1 directory.  After you have 
done that copy the CS5.0/config/cserve.conf to the CS5.1/config
directory.

Do not reuse the command.dat from the CS5.0/config directory or
your bot will not work properly.  If you have made changes to your
levels or command names you must redo after you have started CS5.1
using the command as you did the first time.

I am sorry for the inconvenience that these steps might casue, but
what you want for free.
